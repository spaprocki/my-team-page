## Overview

![screenshot](https://spaprocki.github.io/hosted-assets/my-team-page-screenshot.PNG)

To coplete this challenge, I've used the same method, as for the completion of the previous one - I've bound elements' sizes with viewport width. Respective sizes were represented in .css files in vw units.

Site demo can be seen at: (https://papi-my-team-page.netlify.app/)
